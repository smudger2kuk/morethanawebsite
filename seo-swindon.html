        <div class="full-page">
            <section>
                <p>Wouldn’t it be great if you published a website and people could find you in Google right away for the exact keyword search that you’re targeting?</p>
                <p>Driving traffic to your site doesn’t have to be difficult… if you want to pay for it. However, if you want free, organic visitors to your site then your web pages and the content within them need to be optimised to give your business the best chance of success.</p>
                <p>That is where SEO comes in... (if you already know what SEO is then <a href="#solutions">skip this section</a>)</p>
                <h3 class="darkgreen"><em><strong>What our SEO services can do for your website…</strong></em></h3>
                <p>Our SEO services vary from keyword optimisation techniques all the way to a full SEO audit with a comprehensive report full of recommendations as the output. We can do one-off optimisation for specific keywords or partner with you to monitor your search engine rankings and make regular updates to your site to drive your pages up the search engine results pages (SERP).</p>
                <div style="" class="bg-yellow fun-facts right">
                    <img src="images/icons/seo-top-3-results.png" class="icon">
                    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
                    <p>On average, the top 3 listings in Google get over 55% of all clicks!</p>
                </div>
                <p>We will ensure that the content on your website is optimised for the search term(s) you wish to rank well for. That means basics such as ensuring correct use of headings, photos and alt tags but also testing your site for mobile optimisation as this is a key ranking factor these days. We can re-write or tweak existing content as well as add new pages and content that targets the keywords that are important to your business.</p>
                <p>With each of our packages we provide on-going monitoring of your site’s ranking in Google, including the keywords potential customers are using to find your site, or worse, your competitors’ site. We can complete competitor analysis to see why others are performing better than your business in the SERPs.</p>
                
                <p>Link building is the practice of obtaining a link to your website from another. We carefully select partners to ensure our links are above board and aren’t going to be penalised by Google or other search engines. Link building is paramount to success in SEO and as such we are very particular about how we choose to go about this. Other companies may pay a small fee for a hundred links from strangers in countries like Philippines and China but ours are sourced from the same country as your website, the UK. We select domains with a strong Google standing in order to get the greatest benefit for your site and don’t maintain our own network of sites purely for linking purposes (this is a prohibited practice with search engines).</p>

                <h3>Search Engine Optimisation (aka SEO)</h3>
                <p>In its simplest form, SEO is a wide range of factors that affects how Google and other search engines (Bing, Yahoo, etc.) view your website and the content within it. In more detail, Google and other search engines use “bots” to crawl the web for websites and, using very complex algorithms, reads every page it finds to determine what the page is trying to tell a visitor. The search engines then store all of this information in order to serve up the most relevant website to users when they use their search engine to find results.</p>
                <div style="" class="bg-darkgreen fun-facts left">
                    <img src="images/icons/keyword-search-term.png" class="icon">
                    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
                    <p>A "keyword" is the search term used by someone using a search engine to find something.</p>
                </div>
                <p><em>For example:</em></p>
                <p>When I type in the keyword “football” into Google the first result I find is BBC Sport, followed by Sky Sports and then Talk Sport. These results are deemed to be the most relevant results for my rather generic search term “football”. I can’t say that I’d disagree and it’s highly likely that whatever I wanted to find out about football I could find on any of those websites.</p>
                <p>It is said that Google itself has over 200 factors that it uses to determine the relevancy of a website when ranking them for certain keywords. Obviously they don’t share those as it would make the system very easy to manipulate, however, through years of trial and error we have a very good idea of what works and what doesn’t.</p>
